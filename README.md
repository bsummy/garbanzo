Attempting to build an AI &amp; Computer Vision Powered Robot. This is for the University of Helsinki Computer Science Project Course.

Our unifying theme is using AI to steer robots, and we intend to have 2-3 prototypes

1) Hand-tracking instructions



Instructions: (ask Bennett for help to set up)
pip3 install requirements.txt
or
pip3 install opencv-python
brew install open-cv

2) NLP instructions
 from a human to LLM
Given human readable instructions to LLM, LLM generates instructions for the robot.

3) LLM instructions

LLM steers the robot itself, however it wants, given a goal
